<div class="steps">
<p class="steps">Step 1:</p>
<p>Peel the potato then cut into evenly sized wedges (2cm) then place in a deep sauecpan with enough water to just cover them, and boil in high heat with the lid for 6-8 mins till fluffy and about to fall apart</p>
<p><br>Step 2:</p>
<p>Drain by slightly opening the lid carefuly to not break any fries. then place in a big enough oven dish for an even layer and coat well in olive oil. Wiggle carefully to spread the oil and fries without breaking them. Then bake in the oven at 230deg for 60-75mins flipping halfway and adding more oil if too dry. Then drain of oil and season.</p>

<p><br>
  Step 3:</p>
<p>Meanwhile, grate the onion, and mix with the mayo, ketchup and worcestershire sauce and set aside the special sauce for now</p>  
<p><br> Step 4:</p>
<p>Then add the beef mince and egg, Season with salt and pepper then mix together with your hands. Roll the mince into even-sized balls.</p>
<p><br>Step 5:</p>
<p>a) Then heat some oil in a pan and squish the mince balls onto the pan, to make a burger shape. Use a spatula and some wax paper in between to stop it sticking, and fry till cooked 10-12 mins, flipping every 3 mins. <br> b) You can add abit of the speical sauce towards the end ontop, and leave for 1 min before flipping. After the final flip, place the cheese on the burger side without the sauce till melted.</p>
