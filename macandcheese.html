    <h3 class="directions">Directions</h3>
    <div class="steps">
      <p class="steps">Step 1:</p>
      <p>
        In a deep pan, boil enough water to cover the macaronin pasta and add the pasta into it. simmer until tender, 12 mins. Once cooked, drain in a
        colander and pop back into the pan. Drizzle with oil and stir through to
        stop it sticking together.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
        Step 2:
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, Preheat your oven to 220°C/200°C fan/gas mark 7. Grate the Cheddar
        cheese and set aside. Then grate the blue cheese and add into a bowl with the breadcrumbs.
        Season with salt and pepper, stir in the olive oil, mix and also set aside.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
        Step 3:
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, halve any large cauliflower florets and pop them into an ovenproof dish.
        Drizzle with oil and season with salt and pepper, then toss to coat.
        Spread out in a single layer. When the oven is hot, roast on the top
        shelf until golden brown and tender, 15-20 mins. Turn halfway through.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
        Step 4:
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, heat the oil for the roux sauce (see ingredients for
        amount) in a saucepan on medium-high heat. Heat some oil, stir in
        the flour (see ingredients for amount). Cook until it forms a paste, 1-2
        mins - you've made a roux! Gradually stir in the water for the sauce
        (see ingredients for amount) and the vegetable stock paste. Bring to the
        boil, stir and simmer until thickened, 1-2 mins. Stir in the creme
        fraiche, then remove from the heat.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
        Step 5:
      </p>
      <p>
        Add the Cheddar cheese to the sauce and stir until melted. Taste and
        season with salt and pepper if needed. Return the pan to low heat and
        stir in the spinach a handful at a time until wilted and piping hot, 1-2
        mins, then remove from the heat. Stir the roasted cauliflour and the cooked
        pasta through the sauce, then pour into the ovenproof dish. Turn your
        grill on to high.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
        Step 6:
      </p>
      <p>
        Sprinkle the blue cheese crumb mix evenly over the top, then grill the mac
        and cheese on the top shelf of your oven until the crumb is golden, 3-5
        mins. Serve and Enjoy!
