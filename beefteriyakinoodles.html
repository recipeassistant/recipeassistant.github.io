    <h3 class="directions">Directions</h3>
    <div class="steps">
      <p class="steps">Step 1:</p>
      <p>
        Preheat oven to 240°C/220°C. Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil
        for the noodles, with 1/4 tsp salt. Trim the aubergine into 1cm chunks.
        Pop onto a large baking tray. Drizzle with oil, season with salt and
        pepper. Spread out & roast until soft and golden, 15-20 mins. Turn
        halway through.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
        Step 2:
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, begin precooking your meat, trim the green beans and chop into thirds. Peel and grate the
        garlic. Roughly chop the coriander. Halve the chilli lengthways & chop.
        Set your coriander, chilli and peanuts aside for garnishing later.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
        Step 3:
      </p>
      <p>
        When your pan of water is boiling, add the noodles and green beans and
        bring back to the boil. Cook until tender, 4 mins. Once cooked, drain in
        a colander. TIP: Run the noodles under cold water to stop them sticking
        together and to keep the beans vibrant.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
        Step 4:
      </p>
      <p>
        Heat a drizzle of oil in a large frying pan on medium-high heat. Add the
        Chinese leaf and stirfry until softened, 3-4 mins. Add the meat, stir in the ginger
        puree and garlic, then stir-fry for 2 mins more.
      </p>

      <p>
        <br />
        Step 5:
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the meat is cooked, pour in the teriyaki sauce and stir to coat, off the heat if
        necessary. Add the cooked noodles and green beans to the pan, then
        stir-fry until everything is well coated and piping hot, 1-2 mins. Taste
        and season if needed. Add a splash of water if it's a little thick. Top with as much coriander, chilli and peanuts as you'd like.
