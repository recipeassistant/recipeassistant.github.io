    <h3 class="directions">Directions</h3>
    <div class="steps">
      <p class="steps">Step 1:</p>
      <p>
        a) Bring a saucepan of water up to the boil with 1/2 tsp salt for the
        pasta. b) When boiling, add the penne to the water and cook until
        tender, 12 mins. c) Once cooked, drain in a colander. d) Pop back into
        the pan with a drizzle of oil and stir through to stop it sticking
        together.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
        Step 2:
      </p>
      <p>
        a) Meanwhile, peel and grate the garlic (or use a garlic press). b)
        Halve, peel and thinly slice the shallot.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
        Step 3:
      </p>
      <p>
        a) Heat a drizzle of oil in a large frying pan on medium-high heat. b)
        Once the oil is hot, add the chicken to the pan and season with salt and
        pepper. IMPORTANT: Wash your hands after handling raw chicken. c) Fry
        until golden brown on the outside, 5-6 mins. d) Add the shallot to the
        chicken and cook until soft, 3-4 mins.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
        Step 4:
      </p>
      <p>
        a) Add the garlic and Cajun spice mix (add less if you don't like too
        much heat). Cook, stirring frequently, for 1 min. b) Add the water for
        the sauce (see ingredients for amount), tomato sauce and chicken stock paste.
        c) Bring to a boil and turn the heat down to simmer. Cook, stirring
        occasionally until thickened, 10-12 mins.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
        Step 5:
      </p>
      <p>
        a) Once the sauce has thickened slightly, add the spinach a handful at a
        time, stirring it in until wilted and piping hot, 1-2 mins. b) Stir
        through half the grated hard Italian style cheese. c) Stir through the
        creme fraiche and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat. d) Taste and
        season with salt and pepper if needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
        Step 6:
      </p>
      <p>
        a) Pop the drained pasta into the creamy sauce and mix well to combine.
        Reheat until piping hot if needed. b) Share the pasta and sauce between
        your bowls, sprinkle over the remaining cheese. Enjoy!
