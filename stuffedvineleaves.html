    <h3 class="directions">Directions</h3>
    <div class="steps">
      <p class="steps">Step 1:</p>
      <p>
        Preheat your oven to 220°C/200°C fan/gas mark 7. Bring a large saucepan
        of water to the boil with 1/2 tsp salt for the pasta. Grate the Cheddar
        cheese. Put the blue cheese and panko breadcrumbs in a small bowl and
        season with salt and pepper. Stir in the olive oil for the crumb (see
        ingredients for amount), then set aside your blue cheese crumb for
        later.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
        Step 2:
      </p>
      <p>
        Halve any large cauliflower florets and pop them into an ovenproof dish.
        Drizzle with oil and season with salt and pepper, then toss to coat.
        Spread out in a single layer. When the oven is hot, roast on the top
        shelf until golden brown and tender, 15-20 mins. Turn halfway through.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
        Step 3:
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, when your pan of water is boiling, add the macaroni and bring
        back to the boil. Cook until tender, 12 mins. Once cooked, drain in a
        colander and pop back into the pan. Drizzle with oil and stir through to
        stop it sticking together.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
        Step 4:
      </p>
      <p>
        While the pasta cooks, heat the oil for the roux (see ingredients for
        amount) in a saucepan on medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, stir in
        the flour (see ingredients for amount). Cook until it forms a paste, 1-2
        mins - you've made a roux! Gradually stir in the water for the sauce
        (see ingredients for amount) and the vegetable stock paste. Bring to the
        boil, stir and simmer until thickened, 1-2 mins. Stir in the creme
        fraiche, then remove from the heat.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
        Step 5:
      </p>
      <p>
        Add the Cheddar cheese to the sauce and stir until melted. Taste and
        season with salt and pepper if needed. Return the pan to low heat and
        stir in the spinach a handful at a time until wilted and piping hot, 1-2
        mins, then remove from the heat. Stir the roasted cauli and the cooked
        pasta through the sauce, then pour into the ovenproof dish. Turn your
        grill on to high.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
        Step 6:
      </p>
      <p>
        Sprinkle the blue cheese crumb evenly over the top, then grill the mac
        and cheese on the top shelf of your oven until the crumb is golden, 3-5
        mins. Serve your pasta in bowls with the sriracha drizzled over the top
        (careful, it's hot - add less if you don't like heat). Enjoy!
